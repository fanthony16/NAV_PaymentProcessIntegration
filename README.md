##### NAV_PaymentProcessIntegration
This is a business to business integration between Microsoft Dynamics NAV and a third party application hosted by the bank.

The objective of the integration is to improve payment process to vendors and employees by eliminating duplicated approval workflow process on the 
bank web platform and leverage only on the existing approval workflow on Dynamics NAV.

The integration was implemented between Dynamic NAV and the third party (Bank) application by sharing generated payment request files after the workflow has been completed on NAV.
